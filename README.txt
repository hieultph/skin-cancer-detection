# Skin Cancer Detection

## About This Project

This project leverages AI to detect skin cancer using deep learning models, providing an accessible and user-friendly web platform for medical diagnostics. The goal is to assist in early detection by utilizing AI-based image analysis.

### Technologies Used:
- **ReactJS** – Developed the front-end interface for user interaction.
- **AWS Cloud** – Hosted and deployed the AI model for scalability and efficiency.
- **Deep Learning** – Implemented AI-based image recognition to classify skin cancer types.

## How It Works
1. Users upload an image of a skin lesion.
2. The AI model analyzes the image and provides a prediction.
3. Results are displayed with confidence scores, helping users and medical professionals make informed decisions.
